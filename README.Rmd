`meandr` allows you to easily generate random data from continuously differentiable functions. This is particular useful for simulating time-series data such as weather conditions - or any physical phenomena that maintain a clear local trajectory.

## Installation

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("sccmckenzie/meandr")
```

## Example

```{r example, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(meandr)

meandr(seed = 17) %>% 
  mplot()
```
