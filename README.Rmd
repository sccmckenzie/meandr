`meandr` allows you to easily generate random data that is continuously differentiable (essentially a 2nd-order spline). This is particular useful for simulating time-series data such as weather conditions - or any physical phenomena that maintain a clear local trajectory.

## Installation

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("sccmckenzie/meandr")
```

## Example

Each call to `meandr()` produces a unique tibble of coordinates.

```{r example, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(meandr)

df <- meandr()

df
```
`mplot` is included as a quick `ggplot2` wrapper.

```{r plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
mplot(df)
```
