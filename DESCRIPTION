Title: Easily generate continuous coordinates following random trajectory
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Scott McKenzie <sccmckenzie@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Scott McKenzie <sccmckenzie@gmail.com>
Description: Family of functions that generate data from continuously differentiable functions.
    This is particular useful for simulating time-series data such as weather conditions - 
    or any physical phenomena that maintain a clear local trajectory.
    Inflection points, or "nodes", are tunable, allowing you to control overall smoothness.
